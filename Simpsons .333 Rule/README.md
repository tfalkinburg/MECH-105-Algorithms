# This algorithm does LU Decomposition of a matrix using pivoting. It takes an input matrix A and decomposes it into an upper and a lower matrix.
## LU decomposition with pivotiing
### inputs:
	A = coefficient matrix
### outputs:
	L = lower triangular matrix
	U = upper triangular matrix
  P = the permutation matrix
  
# [L, U, P] = luFactor(A)
