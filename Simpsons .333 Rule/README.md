# This algorithm uses the Simpson's 1/3 Rule to numerically evaluate an integral. It takes an input vector containing X values, and another vector containing Y values.
## Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
### Inputs
    x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
    y = the vector of function values with respect to x
### Outputs:
    I = the numerical integral calculated
