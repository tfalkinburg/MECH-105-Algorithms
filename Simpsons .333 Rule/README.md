# This algorithm uses the Simpson's 1/3 Rule to numerically evaluate an integral. It takes an input vector containing X values, and another vector containing Y values.
## Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
### Inputs
    x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
    y = the vector of function values with respect to x
### Outputs:
    I = the numerical integral calculated

# [I] = Simpson(x, y)

# WARNING :
Algorithm only works with a 3x3 matrix, and the pivoting function does not work.
